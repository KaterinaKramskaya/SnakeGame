# SNAKE! 

Thank you so much for your interest in small realization of this nice game ;) 

I wanted to train my "skills" in work with GIT and basi—Å principles of object-oriented programming.
So, I was inspired by GeekBrains course, you can find it by the following link:

[geekbrains.ru]( https://geekbrains.ru/courses/70?utm_source=youtube.com&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=description&utm_content=courses_70)

## RULES:
Chose your speed level and move to eat some "apples"!
Rules are so easy - do not fit with walls of the map and with your tail... And do not move back!

Good luck for you ;)
